#Bored on train 2.0

Once upon a time I made a chat client and server to prove that it could be done
using only javascript and php (and ofc some mysql and html etc). It pretty
much sucked, both regarding functionality and reliability. And the architecture
was a real mess. But as a proof of concept, it actually worked. 

This time I intend to do it properly, but using websockets instead of http
requests, node.js instead of php, and backbone and underscore.js instead of a 
random mess of arbitary files and spaghetti. Just for the fun of it.

I will start soon. Eventually.
